# Extended Abstract
This is an example of a research pipeline. The original data covered 
`r dim(dt_all)[1]` individuals. The subset, in which we focused on the 
`r definitions$subset_sex` sex contained `r dim(dt_studypop)[1]` individuals. 
The mean income for this group was `r sprintf("%.2f",round(mean(dt_studypop$income),2))` 
units. We can also use citations in this pipeline, for example as part 
of a literature review or discussion [@andersson2004childbearing]. 

# A Figure 
That is the relation between income and age for the studied `r definitions$subset_sex` 
subset:

```{r fig.pos = 'H', echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"} 
include_graphics(here::here("RImages/plot.jpeg"))
```

Figure 1: `r plot_title `

# A Table Example 
And that's a table for the subset.

Table 1: `r table_studypop_title`

```{r allsev, echo = FALSE, results= 'asis'} 
knitr::kable(table_studypop)
```
